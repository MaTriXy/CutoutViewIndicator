Flexible Indicators for Android
===============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fuzz-productions/CutoutViewIndicator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fuzz-productions/CutoutViewIndicator)

These indicators animate every little touch on your [ViewPager][1].

Want to use a [SpinningViewPager][2] instead? Just [enable an offset][3]
and you're good to go. Need even finer control? Under the hood,
**CutoutViewIndicator** extends LinearLayout; cell styling is done
through LayoutParams. You can set individual values dynamically on
these params and Android's View save/restore state logic will keep
them in order.

You can define each cell directly in your xml file, or add them manually.
Note that the Generators shipped with this library only support
ImageViews and TextViews. We expect the vast majority of integrations
will be satisfied with the default Generator choices.

There is functional support for RecyclerViews in the included
mobile app code - check out [RecyclerStateProxy][4] for details.

The sample mobile app in use:

![An Android device screen, its background a light blue. Near the top 
lies a dark blue ViewPager - just 20 dp below it is a row of narrow
rectangles, all but one of which are dark blue too. One of these
rectangles, however, is orange. As the animated gif plays, we see
the ViewPager page to new views. The orange bar underneath reliably
indicates exactly which page is currently showing, mimicking the
slightest perturbation in the ViewPager](http://i.imgur.com/fKOez3z.gif)

![Sample scrolling effect with ClippedImageCellGenerator and
RecyclerView. The RecyclerView scrolls vertically through colored
rectangles, each a child View, each equal in width and height to the
RecyclerView itself. An indicator on the left side mirrors these
movements with a star-shaped indicator. Thanks to the
ClippedImageCellGenerator, the star appears to move under the views,
showing only half of itself when half of the associated cell
is visible.](http://i.imgur.com/WwhvqT3.gif)

There's demo source code for mobile under the `mobile` directory; we're
looking to expand compatibility to Android Wear and Android TV too.

Adding to a gradle project:
---------------------------

In your app-level `build.gradle`: ensure your repository list includes
jitpack.io, then add the artifact as a dependency.

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://jitpack.io"
    }
}
```
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.fuzz-productions:CutoutViewIndicator:v0.9.0'
}
```


Sample code:
------------

Add a view like this to your xml layout.
```
<com.fuzz.indicator.CutoutViewIndicator
        android:id="@+id/indicator"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_below="@id/cutoutViewIndicator"
        android:orientation="horizontal"
        app:rcv_drawable="@drawable/indicator"
        app:rcv_drawable_unselected="@drawable/indicator_background"
        app:rcv_internal_margin="@dimen/indicator_internal_spacing"
        app:rcv_tools_indicator_count="4"
        />
```

Note that `rcv_drawable` and `rcv_drawable_unselected` default to 0.
You won't see the indicator unless `rcv_drawable` is set to something,
so be sure not to forget about it.

You can leave `rcv_drawable_unselected` equal to 0 if you want a
transparent background.

In your Java (or other JVM-compatible language) file, get a reference
to the view and set it up with a ViewPager.

```
ViewPager pager;
pager.setAdapter(adapter);


// Activity
CutoutViewIndicator cvi = (CutoutViewIndicator) findViewById(R.id.indicator);
cvi.setViewPager(pager);
...
// Fragment
CutoutViewIndicator cvi = (CutoutViewIndicator) view.findViewById(R.id.indicator);
cvi.setViewPager(pager);
...
// DataBinding
CutoutViewIndicator cvi = binding.indicator;
cvi.setViewPager(pager);
```

Then you're good to go. When you're done with the view, it's probably a
good idea to de-initialise the CutoutViewIndicator.

```
cvi.setViewPager(null);
```

If you want to use something other than simple ImageViews, you can
set your own Generator on the object.

```
cvi.setGenerator(new GifGenerator());
```

`ImageCellGenerator` is designed for extensibility - consider
subclassing your custom Generator from that if its views extend
ImageView.

The base library also ships with an experimental CutoutCellGenerator
called `TextCellGenerator`. Check out the javadoc for details on how
to work with it.

Caveats
-------

Right now it only supports Android SDK 14 and up
(that makes it compatible with Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, Lollipop,
Marshmallow, and Nougat), but there's little stopping it from being
backported all the way to APIv11.

Grab a copy of the demo application (live apk coming soon) to try
it in action.
